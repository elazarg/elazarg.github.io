I am Elazar Gershuni.

I build and maintain formal-methods-heavy systems that need to work in practice.
I am also a PhD candidate, and research is a central part of my work.
My default mode is open research: I develop projects, code, and artifacts publicly and continuously.

I am the chief maintainer of [PREVAIL](https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf_verifier), and I am porting it to Rust in [prevail-rust](https://github.com/elazarg/prevail-rust) with a parity-first approach.

My current program is Vegas:
- Foundations for reasoning about strategic protocols.
- The [vegas](https://github.com/elazarg/vegas) compiler, which turns specifications into analyzable and executable artifacts.
- [thrones](https://github.com/elazarg/thrones), a workbench for interactive game-theoretic analysis.

The common thread is practical rigor at the boundary of game theory, blockchain protocols, formal verification, and practical cryptography.

Selected work:
- [pythia](https://github.com/elazarg/pythia): static analysis for Python bytecode.
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): contributor, working with the maintainer team led by Jukka Lehtosalo and Guido van Rossum.
- [np-guard](https://github.com/np-guard/models): contributor.
- [anyway](https://github.com/data-for-change/anyway): civic-tech work for road-safety transparency.
- Lean ecosystem: contribution to the Lean standard library, and [kraft](https://github.com/elazarg/kraft), where I formalized the Kraft-McMillan inequality, a constructive converse via prefix-free code existence, and source-coding results (entropy lower bound and an entropy-plus-one existence bound), with parts being upstreamed to Mathlib.
- [nakdimon](https://nakdimon.org): a Hebrew diacritizer for restoring niqqud (vowel marks) in unpointed Hebrew text.

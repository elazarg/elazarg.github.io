I am a programming-languages enthusiast, interested in questions of expressivenes, and the interplay with logic.

I speak Python, C, C++, Java, C#, Javascript, Scala and more. I love playing around with functional programming and COQ.

I am contributing code to [mypy](http://github.com/python/mypy), a static type checker for Python. Check it out, it works!

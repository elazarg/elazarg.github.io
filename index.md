I am a programming-languages enthusiast, interested in questions of expressivenes, and the interplay with logic.

I am Proficient in Python, C, C++ and Java. I love playing around with COQ and SMLnj.

In my free time I am contributing code to [mypy](http://github.com/python/mypy), a static type checker for Python. Check it, it works!

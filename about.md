I am a programming languages researcher and engineer, currently a PhD candidate, focused on building systems where correctness claims are explicit and checkable.
My default mode is open research: I develop projects, code, and artifacts publicly and continuously.

I work across language design, static analysis, and formal methods, with an emphasis on end-to-end artifacts: semantics, implementation, tests, and maintainable workflows.

I am the chief maintainer of [PREVAIL](https://github.com/vbpf/ebpf_verifier), an abstract-interpretation eBPF verifier, and its [Rust port](https://github.com/elazarg/prevail-rust).

My current focus is the Vegas program, a language-and-tooling stack for strategic protocols and game-theoretic analysis:
- Foundations for reasoning about strategic protocols.
- The [vegas](https://github.com/elazarg/vegas) compiler, which turns specifications into analyzable and executable artifacts.
- [thrones](https://github.com/elazarg/thrones), a workbench for interactive analysis and visualization.

This work sits at the boundary of game theory, blockchain protocols, formal verification, and practical cryptography.

Selected technical work:
- [pythia](https://github.com/elazarg/pythia): static analysis for Python bytecode.
- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy): contributor, working with the maintainer team led by Jukka Lehtosalo and Guido van Rossum.
- [np-guard](https://github.com/np-guard/models): contributor.
- Lean ecosystem: contribution to the Lean standard library, and [kraft](https://github.com/elazarg/kraft), where I formalized the Kraft-McMillan inequality, a constructive converse via prefix-free code existence, and source-coding results (entropy lower bound and an entropy-plus-one existence bound), with parts being upstreamed to Mathlib.
- [nakdimon](https://nakdimon.org): a Hebrew diacritizer for restoring niqqud (vowel marks) in unpointed Hebrew text.
- [anyway](https://github.com/data-for-change/anyway): civic-tech work for road-safety transparency.

Background:
- Research assistant in NLP with Prof. Alon Itai.
- Teaching assistant in programming languages, program synthesis and databases.
